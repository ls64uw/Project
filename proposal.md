##Project Value:

Our project aims to help the prison to find out which prisoners are really ready to go back to their communities with relatively low risk. 
The current COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions)  system, which is designed to determine the risk of further crimes of prisoners and give them corresponding terms of imprisonment, seems to have a huge bias towards people of color and minorities. We want to check this hypothesis and if it is true, we will try to fit a new model depending on the old one to come up with a more fair judgement of prisoners. This could also help reduce the redundant work of the justice system and build safer communities.


- Reduce/understand the bias on existing models that mark African American with higher defendant risk scores, while white people tend to have lower risk scores.

- Maintain the overall risk scores accuracy with our adjustment.

##Dataset:

We have 3 datasets with each prisonersâ€™ demographic (sex, race, age and etc.), criminal history, jail, prison time, and COMPAS risk scores from Broward county. The COMPAS score dataset consists of 11758 files of previous criminals and whether they had committed crime within 2 years after they had been scored. Our analysis will especially explore the race features to the concern of bias on scores.
